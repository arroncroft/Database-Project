The file reader runs all 11 of the files through the reader. Supply the file names as args[], 
I did it in intelliJ so i added the arguements in the config, if you don't want to type
java Main.java arg1 arg2.....arg 11, feel free to comment out all but the one arg you wish
to suppy at a time. Also note********* you need to go to the bottom of the file and enter
your db username and password, i have left these blank. takes about 2 hrs on my mbp so,
find something to do while it runs, or watch it....
